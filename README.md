This is a project I worked on for my Science Extension Major Work. 

It was submitted to the STANSW Young Sciencitsts Awards, where it won the 3rd place AArnet Award.

It was also a national finalist at the ASTA i3 Awards, currently under review.

Please see the pdf in the repository for the full scientific report on the project.
