*** Damage Metrics for FEOL Cleaning ***

- Surface roughness (RMS) – the root-mean-square variation of surface height on the wafer (nm). It
quantifies topographical damage from cleaning; for example, prolonged SC‑1 (NH₄OH/H₂O₂)
exposure increases RMS roughness and correspondingly raises gate‑oxide breakdown rates .

- Defect density – the number of surface defects (particles, scratches, pits, etc.) per unit area (#/cm²).
Cleaning-induced damage often appears as extra defects or broken features; e.g. cleaning with
NH₄OH dramatically increases the defect density on patterned wafers .

- Etch rate (material loss) – the rate of silicon removal by the cleaning solution (Å/min or nm/min).
This measures unintended substrate thinning; for instance, the standard SC-1 clean etches Si at
≈0.8 nm/min (8 Å/min) in a 1:1:5 mixture . Excessive etching alters film thicknesses and device
dimensions.

- Interface trap density (D<sub>it</sub>) – the density of electronic trap states at the Si–SiO₂
interface (cm⁻²·eV⁻¹). Cleaning steps can introduce interface defects; higher D<sub>it</sub> means
more charge traps at the interface, degrading transistor threshold and mobility .

- Fixed oxide charge (Q<sub>f</sub>) – net fixed charge in the gate oxide per area (C/cm²). Damage
from cleaning (e.g. by plasma or residues) can deposit or generate charge in the oxide. A higher
Q<sub>f</sub> shifts device flat-band voltage and impairs oxide reliability .

- Minority carrier lifetime (τ) – the average time minority carriers survive before recombining (μs). A
shorter lifetime after cleaning indicates more recombination centers (surface or bulk defects)
introduced by contamination or damage . This is critical for devices relying on diffusion or drift
carriers.

- PN-junction leakage current – reverse-bias leakage current of a p–n junction (A/cm²). Cleaninginduced defects or metal impurities create generation paths, so higher leakage signals more
damage. For example, heavy-metal residues increase junction reverse leakage .

- Gate-oxide breakdown field – the electric field at which gate oxide fails (MV/cm). Damage
(roughness, contamination) from cleaning degrades oxide integrity; rougher or contaminated
interfaces break down at lower fields . A reduced breakdown field predicts lower device yield.

- Pit density – the number of microscopic etch pits per area (pits/cm²). These pits can form where
metal particles sit during wet cleans. For example, copper particles in SC-1 produce etch pits on the
Si surface . A higher pit density marks localized corrosion/damage that can trap defects.
